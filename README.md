# NumericalDispersion

We use this code because we try to observe the effect of numerical dispersion change with respect to grid size and source frequency change 
Instructions :
1.	Please open script Numerical_Forward_Modeling
2.	Change the velocity value in every layers (line 28)
3.	Change M value (rate of numerical accuracy)
4.	Change grid size (dx & dz)
5.	Change a source frequency (line 94) if you want to observe the effect of the numerical accuracy with respect to the source frequency change
6.	Run
